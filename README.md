The workflow used was to create a program using HTML and CSS within a Codespace in Github.

****Workflow: HTML/CSS -> Codespaces -> GitHub -> Render**

This presents a custom personal Website created using HTML and CSS, and will be hosted on Render.

The workflow that was used started with Github Codespaces and was then deployed onto the Render Server.

The basic structure includes standard header and body sections. 

The styling rules are within the header section. 

The code was validated using the HTML validator given in the lesson.
